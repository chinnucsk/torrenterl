Dependencies:
 * Erlang/OTP R13-B or newer (compiler to build, kernel and stdlib to run)
 * GNU Make (might actually build with some other make as well)
 * Eunit (for testing)

To build the application simply run 'make'. This should build .beam, .app
files and documentation.

Configuration: (environment variables)
 * Not yet

Development:
There are some interesting make targets:
 * test - Will compile and run all tests (using eunit)
 * dialyzer - Will run dialyzer on the application
